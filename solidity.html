	<b>What is Solidity</b>
	<p>Solidity is a programming language used in smart contract development<br>
	It is described as:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Statically-typed</b> - Variable types must be explicitly stated</li>
		<li><b>Curly-braced</b> - Code sections are delimited by curly braces "{}"</li>
		<li><b>Object-oriented</b> - Code is organized into structures called objects</li>
	</ul>
	
	<!-- List of other solidity networks from here: [https://blog.logrocket.com/smart-contract-programming-languages/], [https://definoobs.com/these-blockchains-and-crypto-projects-use-solidity/]-->
	<p>It is primarily used on the Ethereum blockchain network, but has uses in other networks, such as Binance Smart Chain, Tron, Avalanche, and Hedera.</p>

	<b>Why Solidity?</b>
	<p>This tutorial will use Solidity since it is : </p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Commonly used </b> - If additional assistance required, greater volume of resources available.</li>
		<li><b>Dedicated to smart contracts</b> - </li>
		<li><b>Simple</b> - Solidity's syntax is similar to many popular languages, such as C++ and Javascript, and thus it provides a strong
		programming basis that will allow you to learn new languages with relative ease.</li>
	</ul>
